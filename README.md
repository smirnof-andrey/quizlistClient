# Quizlist client for Android
This is client side of my project Quizlist.
It's based on the rather renowned learning platform [Quizlet.com](https://quizlet.com)  
## About Quizlet
Quizlet provides an opportunity to save information as flashcards.  
On the one side of a card you are supposed to put any item (term) you want to remember.
To the other side – an explanation (definition).
Then cards are consolidated to sets by topic. Such sets are called Modules.  
Quizlet application is designed for learners’ usage.
Also, this service can be useful for all people who study anything.
